SVM Implementation without Inbuilt Libraries
-SVM is a powerful classifier that works both on linearly and non-linearly separable dataLinear Separable

-Finds an optimal hyperplane, that best separates our data so that the distance from nearest points in space to itself(also called margin) is maximized

-These nearest points are called Support Vectors
